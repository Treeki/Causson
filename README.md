This project was an experimental programming language implemented in Rust,
which I created from December 2019 to April 2020 as part of my final year
project at the University of Strathclyde.

The code is not particularly great, but I was under heavy time pressure so I
had to cut a lot of corners (while simultaneously learning a lot of new things
about Rust). In spite of that, it worked out okay since I got a grade of
88/100 for this project after worrying I'd screwed it all up...

The report (originally written using LaTeX in Overleaf) is in the `report/`
directory, with a compiled version in the root as `report.pdf`. This also
serves as the only documentation for this project, since I would only be
graded for it if I included it as appendices in the report. Isn't academia
fun?
